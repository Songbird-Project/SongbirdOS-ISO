# SongbirdOS ISO

This repository stores the `archiso` setup to build SongbirdOS images.

## Image Release Naming

SongbirdOS is a rolling release distro but our images are closer to point
release in style. Due to this, similarly to EndeavourOS, our ISOs have names.
Names are up for discussion before any tagged versions of the next release are
put up. After any tagged release has gone out, even early alphas, the name is
no longer up for discussion unless a reason is seen fit.

### Release Name History

The current release name is: **Swallow**

| Semantic Version | Release Name | Stable Release Date |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1.0.0 | Swallow | TBD |
